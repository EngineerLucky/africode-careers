# Africode Careers

Africode Careers is a job board website specifically designed for the tech industry, with a focus on providing programming job opportunities. This platform allows companies to post job openings while enabling job seekers to find positions that match their skills and interests. Users can search for jobs based on keywords and locations, which include several cities across Southern Africa, as well as remote opportunities. The platform also provides features for user authentication, allowing users to create profiles where they can add information relevant to their job search.

Companies using Africode Careers can track job postings and monitor the number of applications they receive. Additionally, job seekers can manage and track their applications, ensuring they stay on top of the jobs they've applied for. The interface has been designed to be fully responsive, making it accessible across different devices. One of the key functionalities of the site is the job recommendation feature, which suggests roles based on the skills users have added to their profiles.

The platform was developed using JavaScript, with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. MongoDB was chosen for the database due to its flexibility and scalability, which is essential for managing job postings and user data. 

The project aims to streamline the job search process for tech professionals and improve how companies manage job applications. While building this project, the main challenges anticipated included implementing efficient filtering systems for job searches, ensuring a smooth and secure user authentication process, and making the platform responsive across all devices.
